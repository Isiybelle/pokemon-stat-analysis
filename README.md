# Pokemon Stat Analysis
Analysis of stats of my Pokemon Shield team vs randomized opponents


As a relatively new pokemon fan but aware of just how much raw data the games have, I was curious if I couldn't analyze my Pokemon Shield team. I wanted to look more into their hard numbers to eventually see if I could learn to predict outcomes from the stats alone. While the awesome battles in-game are obviously the best part, I wanted to look a little more into what makes the magic happen. This was all done in Tableau.

I started by analyzing strength by generation to see where the 'strongest' pokemon have come from and whether they are trending upwards or downwards. Then I looked at stats for the top pokemon of all pokemon, separating by legendary and non-legendary. Afterwards I did a general overview of my Shield team with stats for each of my 6 'mon. From there were the randomized battles as well as the comparative stats for both pokemon involved.

While I was able to accurately predict some battles, some ended up being a toss-up for me. Overall, though, my understanding of the inner workings of the Pokemon games has increased.
